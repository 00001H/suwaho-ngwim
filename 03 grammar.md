# verb foundations
all words are built on verbs, which are then conjugated, nominalised or turned into modifiers.

each verb stem ends with -ə, and this -ə sound is changed based on the part of speech of the resulting word.
whether the -ə sound is replaced with a light or dark vowel depends on the last vowel (before -ə). if there is no vowel before -ə, the dark vowel is used.

| resulting part of speech | vowel class | light | dark |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----- | ---- |
| noun                     | high        | e     | i    |
| verb                     | mid         | a     | o    |
| adverb/particle          | low         | ō     | u    |

here is a list of verb suffixes:
- forming nouns
	- -e/i: subject
	- -em/im: direct object
	- -el/il: nominalisation
		- -el.hō/il.hu: modifier (see [[#markers and basic verbs|hə]])
- forming verbs
	- infinitive verbs
		- -ə: infinitive
		- tense
			- -a/o.pə: past
			- -a/o.tə: present
			- -a/o.kə: future
	- conjugation (mood)
		- -a/o: stative
		- -a.ya/o.yo: interrogative
		- -a.la/o.lo: vocative/imperative
			- note that these can only be used on verbs in the present tense
- forming adverbs/particles
	- -ō/u: forms adverb/particle

adverbs only become particles when they are added at the end of a word.

note that tense does not have to be specified unless deemed necessary.
# pronouns
first, second and third person pronouns are also derived from the verbs *mə*, *nə* and *ngə*, making them *mi*, *ni* and *ngi*. *ngi* can refer to any third person, including "this" or "that". *sə* means "to be a thing", so *si* refers to "a thing".

# markers and basic verbs
everything other than the verb requires a suffix to indicate its case and/or its relation to the verb. these markers, are derived from special verbs. note that all of the following markers have bound verbs. you should put a period (.) between the marker and the bound verb (and thus stress the marker). this is for disambiguation from longer verbs that may end in similar syllables. this applies to all cases, including when the markers are being used as verbs.

these special verbs, along with *mə*, *nə*, *ngə* and *sə* (i.e. all verbs with structure *Cə*/*Gə*) are called tier 1 verbs. there are 15 tier 1 verbs.

| verb | meaning               | particle | particle meaning                         |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| pə   | to use                | -pō/pu   | using, with                              |
| tə   | to be along with      | -tō/tu   | along with                               |
| kə   | to go (towards)       | -kō/ku   | towards, ending at, for (the benefit of) |
| bə   | to come (from)        | -bō/bu   | (starting/originating) from              |
| də   | to be at              | -dō/du   | at, on, in                               |
| gə   | to be regarding       | -gō/gu   | in regards to                            |
| fə   | to be compared (to)   | -fō/fu   | than                                     |
| hə   | to be of              | -hō/hu   | of                                       |
| lə   | to be a subject       | -lō/lu   | subject marker                           |
| yə   | to be a direct object | -yō/yu   | direct object marker                     |
| wə   | to be an alternative  | -wō/wu   | or, alternatively                        |

*mi.lu ni.ho.* i am of you / i am yours.
*mi.lu ni.hu ngo.* i am your thing / i am yours.
*mi.lu ni.ko.* i am towards you / i am going to you.
*ngi.gu mi.lu ko.* in regards to that, i am moving.

note that words ending with -hō/hu modify nouns instead of verbs, and are placed before the thing they are modifying.

# word order
due to the presence of markers, word order is free. however, for the sake of standardisation, this guide will stick to SOV word order. in general, it is recommended that any connectors come first, followed by the subject, and the verb should be at the end. however, this is not necessary.

there is a front-to-back order of emphasis as well, where whatever is in front is emphasised more.

# stacking verbs
to nest or stack verbs, e.g. i want to (go) or i need (you to do this), you can use nominalisation.
for example, "i want to go" can become "i want **the action of going**":
> mi.lu **ngil**.yu dwo. 

or "i want **that i go**":
> mi.lu **mi.lu kil**.yu dwo.

"i need you to do this" can become "i need **you to do this**":
> mi.lu **ni.lu ngil**.yu dyo.
# functional verbs
the following tier 2 verbs are often stacked with other verbs to create more complex meanings. there are 26 tier 2 verbs.
