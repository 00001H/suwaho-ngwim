|                 | -   | bilabial | alveolar | velar | palatal |
| :-------------: | --- | :------: | :------: | :---: | :-----: |
|     plosive     | -   |   p b    |   t d    |  k g  |         |
|      nasal      | -   |    m     |    n     |   ŋ   |         |
|    fricative    | -   |    fʰ    |    sʰ    |   x   |         |
| lateral approx. | -   |          |    l     |       |         |
|     approx.     | -   |          |          |   w   |    j    |

there are three categories of consonants:
- initials (all except /w/ and /j/)
- medials (/w/ and /j/)
- codas (plosives with no audible release, nasals and /l/)

fricatives do not need to be aspirated, but they should be.

# vowels
there are seven vowels. there is a light-neut-dark system, where the neut is just the schwa for the sake of simplicity.
the dark vowel shares the same position as its light counterpart but is slightly more closed.
there are three vowel classes, each with a light-dark vowel pair.

| class | -   | light | neut | dark | notes              |
| ----- | --- | :---: | :--: | :--: | ------------------ |
| high  | -   |  [ɛ]  | [ə]  | [i]  | front close vowels |
| mid   | -   |  [ɒ]  |  ^   | [ɔ]  | back open vowels   |
| low   | -   |  [o]  |  ^   | [u]  | back closed vowels |

# syllable structure
the syllable structure is (I)(M)V(C) for the first syllable, and I(M)V(C) for all others.
MV pairs wu, wo, ji are not allowed, while adjacent vowels are not allowed in native words but allowed for loanwordsx 
```
V = a e i o ō u ə
I = p t k b d g m n ŋ f s h l
M = w y
C = p t k m n ŋ l

$i = I?M?VC?
$s = IM?VC?
words: $i $i$s $i$s$s
```
words can consist of several syllables.
# sound change rules
note that these only apply to adjacent consonants within the same word.
- if /l/ is next to a nasal consonant, it becomes /n/.
	- if it comes before /n/, the /n/ becomes /l/ instead.
	- examples
		- mamla -> mamna
		- manla -> manna
		- malna -> malla
- if a plosive final consonant is followed by a nasal consonant or /l/, it becomes its nasal equivalent.
	- note that the nasalisation of /l/ also applies here
	- examples
		- makna -> maŋna
		- mabna -> mamna
		- matla -> manla -> manna
- if /n/ comes before a plosive, its placement shifts to match that of the plosive.
	- manpa -> mampa
	- manka -> maŋka
# stress
each word (group of syllables, separated by a space) has its first syllable stressed. there are syllables that have dots under them (◌̣). the first syllable after each period should be stressed. in cases where adjacent syllables should be stressed, favor the second one.
for example, *nihọ* should be read ni**ho**.
_mannilhọ_ should be read **man**nil**ho**.
